# Glasgow-Coma-Scale-GCS-assessment   
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological assessment tool used to evaluate a patient's level of consciousness and neurological functioning after a head injury or other neurological conditions.

The GCS is based on three components: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. Each component is scored independently, and the scores are then combined to give an overall GCS score. The maximum score is 15, indicating a fully alert and responsive individual, while the minimum score is 3, indicating deep unconsciousness.

Glasgow-Coma-Scale-GCS-assessment  project deployed in RasberryPi.

seria_test.py  code used to collect real time data using gyro and accelelarometer for motor response assessment.
